# 📊 Student Performance Analysis - Portuguese

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes Portuguese student performance data using **Power BI** to identify patterns and relationships between academic scores and various demographic, socio-economic, and behavioral factors. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations that help educators and policymakers understand factors influencing student outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore student performance trends across different demographics.
- Identify the impact of parental education, absences, and socio-economic status on grades.
- Analyze correlations between lifestyle factors (internet access, alcohol consumption, family support) and final grades.
- Provide insights to improve student academic outcomes.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains academic performance data of students from Portuguese schools, including:
- **G1, G2, G3**: First, second, and final grades.
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, parental education, parental job.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Internet access, alcohol consumption, family support, study time.
- **School-related**: Failures, absences, school type, paid classes.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
### 1. **Performance by Internet Access**
- Students with internet access show varying distributions of final grades (**G3**), with some clustering at higher scores.

### 2. **Absences vs. G3**
- Higher absences tend to correlate with lower final grades.

### 3. **Age vs. G3**
- Students aged **15-17** tend to have higher average grades compared to older age groups.

### 4. **Alcohol Consumption (Dalc) and Higher Education**
- Students with lower daily alcohol consumption tend to perform better.

### 5. **Failures vs. G3**
- Students with **0 failures** have the highest average G3 (~12.51), while repeated failures show lower averages.

### 6. **Family Support & Paid Classes**
- Students with family support (`famsup = yes`) or paid classes tend to have slightly higher G3 scores.

### 7. **Parental Jobs (Mjob & Fjob)**
- Students whose parents work in teaching or health sectors often have higher scores.

### 8. **Reason for Choosing School**
- Reputation and home proximity are top reasons influencing school selection, with minimal performance difference.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Attendance is a major factor — fewer absences correlate with higher grades.
- Parental education and occupation influence student performance.
- Support systems (family support, paid tutoring) positively impact outcomes.
- Younger students tend to perform better academically.
- Lifestyle factors such as internet access and alcohol consumption play a role in results.
